# Influence of different gait reward types on training performance and deployment performance

Two groups are tested:
- **Smooth Gait Function**

    Smooth reward function for gait specification, proposed in [Sim-to-Real Learning of All Common Bipedal Gaits via Periodic Reward Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01387), whose gait indicator curves are as follows:

    ![](./exp_C_frc_smooth_gait.png)

    When `exp_C_frc` is -1, it means foot contact forces are penalized (swing phase); and when `exp_C_frc` is 0, it means foot contact forces are ignored and foot velocity is penalized on the meanwhile (stance phase)

- **Step Gait Function**

    Substitute `uniped_periodic_gait` function with a simple step function. Gait indicator curves for this group are shown below:

## Training Performance

In simulation, difference between **Smooth Gait Function** group and **Step Gait Function** group is as follows:

- **Step Gait Function** group has faster training speed(fewer collection time), due to fewer operations when computing rewards.

- In the context of single-gait learning, **Step Gait Function** group has higher reward, because of the absence of the ambiguous "-0.5" value in **Smooth Gait Function**. But at the end of the day, both methods can learn single gait successfully.

- For multi-gait learning, I have tested learning of three kinds of gaits on go2: trot, bound, pace. Both methods have successfully learned three kinds of gaits and the transition between them. However, the computation efficiency is lower for **Smooth Gait Function** because of the complex formulation and operations to get the gait indicator.
  
## Conclusion

Both methods have the capability of learning multiple gaits, and the **Smooth Gait Function** method is worse in case of computation efficiency.
